# Randomiser
HL2 custom file randomiser (or 'randomizer' if you wish)

Program is intended for use with the game Half-Life 2 to randomise texture, sound etc. files and copy into the 'custom' folder for the game to read.
Source files must first be extracted from the game's resource archive(s) into a folder for this program to read. This process is simple and does not require much (if any) error checking, so this is mainly for posterity & I will most likely not be updating this repo much.

Download and make any changes you wish, I claim no copyrights or trademarks of any kind!
